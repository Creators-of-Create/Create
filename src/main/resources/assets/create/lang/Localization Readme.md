Hi there! 
Looking to contribute with a localization? You've almost come to the right place!

Localizations for Create are now being kindly hosted on Crowdin.  
If you want to help translate, please go to the following link:  
https://translate.createmod.net/project/createmod/invite?h=64e492afe2ffbc180e3419654374135f1536385  
All you need to do is create an account on the Crowdin site, and you should be good to go.


If you need help navigating their UI, please refer to Crowdins help pages:  
https://support.crowdin.com/joining-translation-project/  
https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/

If you want to contribute translations for a language that is not yet available on the Crowdin Project, please reach out to any the team members of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hmaD7Se) server.


In case you provided translations to us before, we ask you to please also use the Crowdin platform in the future instead of creating PRs.
Should you have created a modified .json file with translations like outlined by this document before please reach out to Zelophed#0341 on Discord.


Thank you kindly for your contribution!
